Quantum information theorist. I am broadly interested in how algorithms (both quantum and classical) can help to solve hard computational problems, simulate complex physical phenomena, and learn about the world around us.

I am currently a <a href ="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/gil-herrera-postdoctoral-fellowship/">Gil Herrera Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at Sandia National Labs. I received my PhD in physics from the University of New Mexico, advised by <a href="https://cquic.unm.edu/research/research-groups/miyake-research-group/index.html">Akimasa Miyake</a>. Previously, I did my undergrad at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I was introduced to quantum research through the mentorship of <a href="https://shelbykimmel.com/">Shelby Kimmel</a> (now at Middlebury College).
