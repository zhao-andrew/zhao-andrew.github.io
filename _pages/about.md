Quantum information theorist. I am broadly interested in how algorithms (both quantum and classical) can help to solve hard computational problems, simulate complex physical phenomena, and learn about the world around us.

I am currently a <a href ="https://www.sandia.gov/quantum/gil-herrera-postdoctoral-fellowship/">Gil Herrera Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at Sandia National Labs. I received my PhD in physics from the <a href="http://cquic.unm.edu/">University of New Mexico</a>, advised by Akimasa Miyake.
